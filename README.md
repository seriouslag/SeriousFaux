# DataFaux

DataFaux is a plugin goes to random websites to confuse trackers. It will randomly click on links on these websites to convince the website that you're clicking on the links and confuse their advertising networks.

This project is a fork of the project Noiszy, which is no longer actively maintained. Learn more about the original project at [noiszy.com](https://noiszy.com/) and the [Noiszy blog](https://noiszy.com/blog/).

## Changes from Noiszy:
- Removed Google Analytics
- Rebranded to DataFaux
- Cleaned up the text

Note that this project is still essentially the same as the original project! There haven't been that many drastic changes yet.
